Jiving Janko Horticulture
=============

The purpose of this mod is to provide a realistic feel to gardening and farming in Minecraft.

Many of the features are already planned out, so implementation and art assets are the major work needed.

If you have any inquiries about the development of this mod, feel free to leave me an email at curtis.filchner@gmail.com, and I will try to answer your email ASAP. If there is ever a desire to donate to the development of this mod, I will consider starting a Patreon to assist those who want to support our work.
